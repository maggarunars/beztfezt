Welcome to the official website for BeztFezt!
At BeztFezt, we understand that every festival experience is unique, and that's why we've created a user-friendly platform where you can tailor your festival schedule to perfection. 
The reason for the making of this website is that we felt a need for a better website to schedule your festival days, and BeztFezt is here to simplify your festival planning.
We made filters so you can easily sort through events based on days, type, accessibility, or any other criteria that matter most to you. 
Our interface makes it effortless to add, edit, or remove events from your own schedule, which we call “my events.” 
Sharing events with family and friends is also an option so you can plan your festival days together. 
By using BeztFezt, you can focus on what truly matters: enjoying the music, art, and culture of the festival without the stress of planning.
Enjoy!
